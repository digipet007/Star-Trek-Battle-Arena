# unit-4-game

This is a Star Trek battle arena game, an interactive game to be played in your web browser. Choose your hero from a list of Worf, Picard, Spock, and Gorn.  Then, choose your opposing enemy to battle from the remaining characters. Each character in the game has 3 attributes: `Health Points`, `Attack Power` and `Counter Attack Power`. Open the console to view each character's stats. Each time your character attacks, their `Attack Power` permanently increases by 6 points for the duration of the game. Win the game by cleverly selecting the proper order of opponents to attack and defeating all opponents.
